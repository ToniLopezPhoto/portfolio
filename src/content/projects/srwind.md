Sr. Wind is an immersive experience in which the poetry of the writer Juan José Hernández and the photography of the visual artist Toni López enter into symbiosis to offer a journey through an autobiographical story full of secrets and surprises. A wonderful story that deals with the non-acceptance of the echoes of the past.
